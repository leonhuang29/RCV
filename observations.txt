(-0.5, 0.0, 0.5) seems to be a pretty consistent Nash for distributions that peak at the center in the half restriction
in non symmetric distributions it seems to be nash to copy your opponent
lemma idea: 

if player one plays (x, y, z) and is in Nash, then player two playing (x, y, z) is also a Nash

there always is a mix and match phenomenon: if i give you two optimum mixed strategies that are distinct,
i must also be able to get a pair of equilibrium strategies by swapping 

a1 b1 
a2 b2 

then a1 b2 and b1 a2 must also be an equilibrium pair 

calculating stuff 

ultimately, what we would like is a way of taking any arbitrary set of positions
in terms of where i place candidates

let's say my 3 against your three

if i want to know the outcome, i need to know how the elimination process unfolds
relative to where the voters are 

how to do that? we're making the assumption that for any voter within this metric space
their ranked order is determined by the proximity to the six candidates

as i think about some point on the line in terms of where a voter could be, then 
i have some ranked order
fixing the competition: these three vs those three

all of the people that are like me (at that point) have the same order
but when does that change? there is a point of inflection

the "slider" only changes when there is a tie between candidates, that is when the set
of possible ballots changes

the only time the order changes is when two candidates get equally close

there is a unique midpoint between two candidates! 

for any potential election, he can know how many people there are in any given ordering in a 
computable way 

comes down to adding up how many voters in each interval
