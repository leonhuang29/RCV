# RCV

This is a simulator for Ranked Choice Voting. It is intended to help us calculate Nash equilibria. 

Right now, everything is simulated under the discrete 5 voter locations scenario. 
To interpret the things in results folder, the subfolders represent voter densities
For example, "53235" represents density 5 at position -1 and 1, 3 at -0.5 and 0.5, and 2 at 0.0# RCV
